- Add missing E/W indicator
# fixed - Check for zero DeltaT data
# done - Convert to page action
- but won't attach when restoring tabs on browser restart. browserAtion also won't
- Add table with status for all races. Then add funny things to it 
	like penalties and bad sails and barrel status and programmer ...
- Error handling - race list at startup, check for stale positions
- Handle unknown races (relaod list?)
- Send current heading/TWA to router so it can deal with the penalty 
(but not sure the router deals ok) 

Michael:
- Create a nice icon to replace the pink 'Z' I made in a hurry
- Remove or implement the vC column (supposed to show Computed speed 
according to options, wind and polars reported in the game)
- Select boat to get routing for (so you could track your other
   boats without switching accounts - or spy on your opponents...)
